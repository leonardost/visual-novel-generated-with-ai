# Visual novel game generated with AI

This is a simple visual novel style game fully generated with AI. I wanted to see if I could quickly generate a simple game, just for fun and for learning.

For this experiment, I used the Cursor IDE with the Claude 3.5 Sonnet model. To generate iamge assets, I used free credits on openart.ai (formerly Dall-E I believe).

From the initial prompt to the final touches, I spent around 2 hours. The only code I wrote myself were the final scenes where the "developer" appears in the game - all the rest was generated and updated by Claude.
